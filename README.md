## ðŸš€ Features

-   **Interactive Color Sliders**: Three distinct sliders to control the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) color channels.
-   **Real-time Preview**: A large container instantly updates to display the color you are creating.
-   **Dynamic UI**: The `AppBar`'s background color also changes in real-time to match your selection.
-   **Live Value Display**: See the exact RGB values (0-255) as you move the sliders.
-   **Smart Text Contrast**: The text displaying the RGB values automatically switches between black and white to ensure it's always readable against the current background color.
